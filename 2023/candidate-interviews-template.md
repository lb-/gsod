# Candidate interviews

Here is the template we used to assess candidates that made it to the interview stage of the selection process.

## Template

### Why are you interested in taking on this project?

### Could you explain what you expect from us to get this project started successfully, and how you expect us to collaborate?

### What is your experience of engaging with developer communities to get their support and feedback on your projects?

### What is your approach to creating a tutorial? Could you please walk us through it?

### Let’s say that you run into a problem with some code or something isn’t working right, how do you troubleshoot these types of problems?

### How comfortable are you with taking some existing code (like the bakery demo) and doing some reverse engineering to show people how to build it or work with it?

# Season of Docs 2023: Wagtail Expression of interest form

Thank you for your interest in participating to Google Season of Docs 2023 with Wagtail! We have been approved for participation with one project: [Create Wagtail developer onboarding tutorials](./proposal-create-wagtail-developer-onboarding-tutorials.md). We’re currently looking for a technical writer to work with us on new tutorials for Wagtail site implementers.

Use this form to express your interest in working with us. Any information submitted here will only be used for the purpose of hiring a technical writer for GSoD 2023 unless stated otherwise.

We accept applications until April 15th, and will contact writers by May 1st.

Please take the time to write genuine, concise answers! We’re all excited by the possibilities of AI writing but we want to hear what _you_ have to say, not what large language models think constitutes a good answer.

# [Wagtail GSoD 2023 tutorial: feedback from](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdq3usBxhUeTcEZuJz5g9Q2fu7Ha6Xtb9swFbd95z68t4zvmg/viewform)

Thank you for helping us improve Wagtail’s new extended tutorial! The tutorial is now [live in the Wagtail docs](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/latest/tutorial/index.html), but will only be visible for the majority of visitors starting in February 2024.
In the meantime, we have a "soft launch" where the tutorial is available for all to see and use, but we’re still collecting feedback and refining the contents.

Please fill out our short form ([wagtail.org/gsod-2023-feedback/](https://wagtail.org/gsod-2023-feedback/)) to provide your feedback.
If you’re keen to give us more extensive feedback than the form allows, we also have a [feedback template document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iLVXcptR4IuHeyX0Zzs4Ko-yWSmkV-kuOKTfARLL9hA/edit).
To use this document,

1. View the template in your browser
2. Under Files, choose "Make a copy"
3. Rename your new copy with your name in the file title
4. On your copy, under Sharing, set sharing to "Anyone with the link – Can comment".

No need to fill in the whole document – any feedback on any of the steps here is invaluable to us.

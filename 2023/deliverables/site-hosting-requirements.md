# Site hosting requirements

## Must

1. **Production-ready**. Demonstrate a setup that matches what real-world websites use.
2. **Free for a month**. Provide a free tier of services, allowing one month of free "learning / experimenting" usage.
3. **OS compatibility**. Support major desktop operating systems – Windows, macOS, Linux.
4. **Accessible**. The services need to be accessible to people with disabilities.
5. **Sustainable**. The services need to have as low of an energy / carbon impact as possible.

## Should

1. **Free indefinitely**. Provide a free tier of services, allowing _indefinite_ "learning / experimenting" usage.
2. **Containerized**. Support environment management / infrastructure definition with containers and configuration files.
3. **Resilient**. Though this doesn’t need to be freely-available, there needs to be clear options for redundancy of application servers, database backups, and files backup.

## Could

1. **Command-line DX**. Compared to a graphical interface, this makes it simpler to troubleshoot and document the different management operations.

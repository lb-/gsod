# Google Season of Docs 2023

## What is Google Season of Docs 2023

> [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) provides support for open source projects to improve their documentation and gives professional technical writers an opportunity to gain experience in open source. Together we raise awareness of open source, of docs, and of technical writing.

Wagtail hopes to participate to this program for the first time ever, after having successfully supported a technical writer as part of [Outreachy’s December 2022 cohort](https://wagtail.org/blog/our-very-first-outreachy-interns/).

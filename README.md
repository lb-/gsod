Welcome! This repository contains all resources for Wagtailâ€™s participation to [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/).

## 2024

ðŸ‘‹ we donâ€™t know whether Season of Docs will happen in 2024, and weâ€™ve not decided whether weâ€™d take part either. If you want to participate with us, please register your interest with [our form: wagtail.org/gsod-apply/](https://wagtail.org/gsod-apply/).

## 2023

ðŸ™Œ itâ€™s happening! We are working with software engineer and technical writer [Damilola Oladele](https://twitter.com/activus_d) ([@activus-d](https://github.com/activus-d)) to produce a new tutorial series for Wagtail developers.
